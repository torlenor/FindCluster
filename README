-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This little tool is used to define clusters on SU(3) gauge configurations
based on the local Polyakov loops
L(x) = \prod_t U_4(x,t) = \theta(x) \phi(x)
using the prescription:
We define a sector number n(x) with 
        -1 for \theta(x) \in [-Pi + \delta,-\pi/3 - \delta]
n(x) =   0 for \theta(x) \in [-Pi/3 + \delta,\pi/3 - \delta]
        +1 for \theta(x) \in [Pi/3 + \delta,-\pi - \delta]
where \delta = f pi/3 and f \in [0,1), the cut parameter.
A cluster is now build out of spatial neighbors with the same sector
number.

The program takes following command line parameters:
  -s, --Ns SSIZE             spatial lattice extent (default = 4)
  -t, --Nt TSIZE             temporal lattice extent (default = 4)
  -f, --fraction FRACTION    fraction (default = 0.0)
  -n, --nmeas NMEAS          number of configurations (default = 1)
  -d, --detail               write detailed output for every calculated 
                             configuration
  -b, --boxes                performs the box counting calculation 
                             (expensive)
  -a, --distance             performs the distance traveled calculation 
                             (expensive)
  -o, --olddata              read old Polyakov loop ev data instead of 
                             wuppertal data
  -w, --writemeas            writes all measurements to file
  -F, --fastmode             Fast Mode: Calculates only radius of largest 
                             cluster
  --3d                       write 3dcluster data files
  -h  --help                 display this help and exit
  -v  --version              output version information and exit

And has the following status outputs to mark what is calculated at the moment:
  Status output:
   r ... reading Polyakov loop data
   c ... identifying center cluster
   p ... identifying percolating cluster
   s ... sorting center cluster
   o ... calculating observables
   b ... calculating box counting observables

The program calculates many observables interesting from percolation theory.
It writes it to *.res files in the end after performing a Jackknife step.
